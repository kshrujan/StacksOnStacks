# StacksOnStacks

## Overview
A Java program that creates a list of Stacks. The stacks have a maximum number of nodes that can be pushed onto them, before a new Stack is created. The nodes are popped off the stacks from right to left as long as the stacks are not empty. The program also contains a "popAtIndex" function that allows the user to determine which stack to pop from.
